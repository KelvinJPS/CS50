	<h2> Writing </h2>
	<p> I always loved stories, and I have never been good at drawing. writing is the tool I can use to write a storie, to
		express a feeling
		to organize my thoughts, to watch them </p>
	<q>There is a saying that "paper is more patient than man -Anna Frank</q>

	<h2>Coding And programming</h2>
	<p>In 2019-2020 I wrote my first lines of code since then I'm still amazed by how many things a computer can do if you
		tell her the correct instrucctions</p>
	<h2> Kickboxing</h2>
	<p> Is the only way I get excited to do exercise, and is a beatiful sport, when you see someone that is really good
		at it, is like poetry in motion. also it teach me, a lot about dicipline, and life
