Load dictionary. 

Load default dictionary. 

By doing so the perfomance could be improved with the default dictionary by creating an a hash table of static arrays instead of one with a linked list.
Also allowing binary search, to improve the searching for a word in the dictionry. 


The hash table. 

The hash table would consist of 26 buckets/spaces, refering each to the  Alphabet. 

Each bucket would have an array. 

the size of the array is the number of words that the dictionary has with that letter.

so if there is 200 words starting with the letter A that would  the size of the array. 


The hash function 

the hash function return the index by looking at the first letter of the word. 


Why is not an optimal solution?

What would happen if a word is added to the dictionary? 

The program would have to calculate, again, how many words are in the new dictionary and would have to add to the each array an space for the new word. 

The counting is linear. 

it wouldn't be able to load dictionaries from any size. 


The general load function
